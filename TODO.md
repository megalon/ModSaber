# ModSaber To-Do List
Here is a list of items floating around that need to get done at some point or another.

## `// TODO`
*List of items that are important and should get done before the next release.*

- [ ] Dependencies and Conflicts with versions
  * ~~Use semver versions~~
  * ~~Internally use caret Ranges: `^1.2.3`~~
  * ~~API picks out the current release of the mod, saves that as a dependency~~
  * Mod installer

- [ ] Public Release
  * Open source the project
  * Setup CI for linting
  * Cleanup `README`
  * Add template files
    * Issue Template
    * Contributing guidelines

## Backburner
*These will probably get done eventually, but aren't quite important enough to do immediately. Some of these might end up being scrapped anyway.*

- [ ] Support other file types
  * Not mods get automatic versioning
  * Tagged appropriately

- [ ] One-liner short description for the mod installer

- [ ] Case-insensitive usernames
  * Probably have an internal "display name" that is the caps of when you signed up.
  * All other requests are done with the lowercase username

- [ ] Admin Guidelines
  * Potentially bring on more admins

## Known bugs to fix
*These should be considered critial to get done.*

* NONE RIGHT NOW \o/
