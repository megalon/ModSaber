# TODO List
Here is a list of items floating around that need to get done at some point or another.

## TODO:
*This is a list of items that should be done before launch.*

- [ ] Dependencies and Conflicts with versions
  * Use semver ranges
- [ ] Editable title and description without a new release
  * Have a seperate edit page that is similar to the publish page
  * Autofills and disables name, version
  * Only shows title and description
  * Endpoint accessable to owner and admin only

## Backburner
*These will probably get done eventually, but aren't quite important enough to do immediately. Some of these might end up being scrapped anyway.*

- [ ] Case-insensitive usernames
  * Probably have an internal "display name" that is the caps of when you signed up.
  * All other requests are done with the lowercase username
- [ ] Support other file types
  * Not mods get automatic versioning
  * Tagged appropriately
- [ ] Show upload timestamp
  * Will help people to see when mods were published
- [ ] Clarify file name if only steam
  * Users are idiots

## Known bugs to fix
*These should be considered critial to get done.*

* NONE RIGHT NOW \o/
